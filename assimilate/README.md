# Neuro-Assimilator Enhanced

## Overview
The Neuro-Assimilator Enhanced project is an advanced version of the Neuro-Assimilator engine, designed to improve security, reliability, performance, and extensibility. This project integrates various features that allow for safe execution of software, efficient resource management, and the ability to extend the functionality through plugins.

## Features
- **Security**: Implements static analysis for native code, cryptographic signature verification, and resource caps to ensure safe execution of payloads.
- **Reliability**: Enhancements include crash isolation for payload execution, rollback mechanisms for the codex, and comprehensive telemetry and audit logging.
- **Performance**: Optimizes execution through asynchronous programming, event-driven monitoring, and persistent memory storage solutions.
- **Extensibility**: Allows for the addition of new software handlers via a plugin management system, supporting dynamic integration of new functionalities.
- **Rust Integration**: Provides a handler for compiling and executing Rust code, enabling high-performance execution within the Neuro-Assimilator framework.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd neuro-assimilator-enhanced
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Build the Rust integration:
   ```
   cd src/rust_integration
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. Run the Neuro-Assimilator engine:
   ```
   python src/neuro_assimilator.py
   ```

## Usage Examples
- To assimilate new software, provide the code and type to the Neuro-Assimilator agent.
- Use the plugin manager to add new handlers dynamically.
- Monitor system performance and reliability through the integrated profiling and logging features.
